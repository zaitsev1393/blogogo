So I started working on first of my little italian restaurants, no more details for now but I got 3 main 'points' to cover with my little project:

1. It solves problem I've recently faced
2. I learn new piece of technology (Angular signals for this one)
3. It can be considered a product, so can be shipped and used by other people

But this is not really the point here.

It's prototype. It has one class (although it's pretty small so far and doesn't need any atomization). One file for styles, one template.

It's ugly as hell.

So I started thinking about making it prettier with one of the design systems or template based on Tailwind CSS I picked to be used in my neat little restaurant. Almost instantly I realized, that almost everything I see online looks pretty much the same. That reminded me about [this article](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33520414).

Everything you see online is so perfect these days. And this makes it uncanny and ugly in some way. I can't say I miss 2003 and Win98 like interfaces, I guess is just miss a bit of the riot in the way we treat regular things.

It's not generally a bad thing, it seems we just found that formula for good enough user experience (in various fields). But do _I_ want my interfaces look like that? What is the right balance here? The safe harbor of the _average good_ vs the unique ugliness of my diletant design vision?

I guess I know the answer, although it's not perfect for today's perfect world.
