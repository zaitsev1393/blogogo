I've just watched [this speech from DHH](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0CDXJ6bMkMY&ab_channel=startupschool) and it's as aspiring as it is simple to digest and process.

I really loved the idea of the small digital businesses as a "nice italian restaurants in the web space", but truly this highlighted the problem I (now) realise, has been with me along all my way as a software developer: creating sofwtare to solve problem, not to write code.

I seemed to be a pretty much good soldier in the "writing code war", but at the moment I feel like I'd like to become at least a general on this war field, or rather a politician, who is staying behind all decisions.

It kinda corresponds with the political figure I read the book about right now, Winston Churchill, who become a great political leader while being an experienced soldier. But also this feels a bit too much to draw this analogy and apply it to my humble persona.

I guessm it's time to build a neat italian restaurant.
